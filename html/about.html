             <h3>Our Motive</h3>

             from Market.Greenfarm provides you varities of fruits and vegetables to you at a fair price and Organic.In these days all run <br>
             for their work they dont have time to buy fruits and vegetables from market.Today we buy everything from<br> 
             Online from groceries to dress.Here we provide fresh fruits and vegetables grown in terrace without using any harmful<br>
              chemicals like pesticides.In these days we cannot find organic friuts and vegetables anywhere so this platform enables you<br>
              to stay healthy by eating organic food.The Wise Man should consider that health is the greatest of human blessings.<br>
              Let food be our medicine. </p>

            <h3> Why we choosen Terrace farming?</h3>
    
            <p class="parag">Fruits and Vegetables can be grown anywhere.Why particularly terrace farming is because,it is a new revolution that every<br> single individual
               take responsibility to grow plants even for their needs without depending from market or from shop. This might be very new form of selling but
               it also enables a opportunity for people without job.For women's its a opportunity to<br> enrole themselves in this work so that they may earn for
               them without depending on their husbands.People who have terrace<br> farming cultivation can come to my Greenfarm website and register their
               information and details and also they can posts<br> their products so that everyone can buy from this platform.</p>
